# Vets In Tech Web Development Course

## Week 1 Day 4


### What are we doing today?
We are learning an easier way to display elements how we want them by using Flexbox.


### Why are we doing this?
The following simple layout requirements are either difficult or impossible to achieve with other tools, in any kind of convenient, flexible way:


- Vertically centering a block of content inside its parent.
- Making all the children of a container take up an equal amount of the available width/height, regardless of how much width/height is available.
- Making all columns in a multiple-column layout adopt the same height even if they contain a different amount of content.


### How do I know if I am tracking?
If you can answer the questions or do these tasks below (and please don't just say in your head yes. Even if you can do it, for practice actually implement each these in each section)
1. You can center a div in the middle of the screen.
2. You know how to select an id that you created on tag.
3. You can stack images horizontally at will.

### Warm Up [10 minutes]

At this point, if you're reading this in your editor, you have successfully perform a git pull!

Be comfortable with this, as this will be a frequent practice.

1. All work will be done in `warm-up.html & warm-up.css`
2. Build the HTML template (Hint: Use the VS Code Emmet Abbreviation!)
3. Inside of the body, create 3 separate (not within one another) `div` with background-color in-line styling as followed:
   1. RGB of 160, 75, 49
   2. Hex Code of 27CCD2
   3. blue
4. If you update your browser, you shouldn't see anything! `div` is sized according to its content! So let's add a `h1` with the text `REDBLUEGREEN` to the first one, `h2` with the text `16 Base Hexadecimal` to the second and `h3` with the text `Common Name` for the third.
5. Inside of `warm-up.css`, using CSS, style `h1`, `h2`, and `h3` accordingly:
   1. lowercase
   2. right aligned
   3. font size of 58 pixels

Finished Early?

1. Add colors of your choice to each of the text!
2. Pull in a new font from google & apply it to `h1`

Having Trouble?

1. Did you use the `style` attribute within the opening tag for your in-line styles?
2. Did you `<link>` your CSS file to your `warm-up.html`?
