# Vets In Tech Web Development Course

## Week 3 Day 2

### Learning Objectives

- loops (For Loop & While loop Only)
- SetTimeout
- SetInterval
- Time
- Create Timer
- Create Countdown

### What are we doing?
- we are covering a last huge piece of arrays which are loops. There are two mains you must know to get started
for and while loops

### Why?
because if our array has dozens of elements that we need to process, we will want to repeat a process on each 
element in the array. Loops enable us to do that.

### How do you know if you are doing well? How do you know if you are on track to be a Front End Developer?

- You can iterate through an array and print its contents


### Things students forget
array dot vs bracket notation
object dot vs bracket notation



### Extra time
Practice practice practice. Redo what we did today.
