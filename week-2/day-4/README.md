BARE MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS 
- As long as you create animated carousel as was demonstrated on Tuesday and you create a javascript carousel that you can change images by clicking next or previous buttons you have reached our skillset benchmark for week 2.

For a challenge, try implementing any or all of the bullets below
- Use an external style sheet instead of internal or inline
- Import the external js file instead of a script tag
- Center the carousel window in the middle of screen using margin or flex
- Use position absolute and position relative to move the buttons inside of the window div for users to click
- If you do not use the above,  center the buttons underneathe the center carousel window
- Add some conditional logic to your javascript code to prevent users from translating the imageSlider too far in either direction
- Add console logs to see what your current position is any time the prevImage or nextImage functions are invoked
- Automate your js carousel with setTimeout, and make it move forwards then backwards once it renders the last image on the screen (see video)
